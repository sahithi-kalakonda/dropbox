### Project Introduction
DropBox is an AWS cloud-hosted web application provides authorized users with a safe environment for managing their files online. It makes it easier to upload, download, update, and delete files from any location. This three-tier application uses a variety of AWS resources to guarantee high availability, scalability, and a reasonably priced way to back up data on Amazon S3 and CloudFront. By employing AWS auto-scaling technology, the application effortlessly manages the load during periods of peak demand. Additionally, it makes use of CloudWatch, AWS Lambda, and SNS to track the health of EC2 instances linked to the auto-scale group.
